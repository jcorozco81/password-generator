Password Generator Script



## Description

The Password Generator Script was created with the purpose of providing the user a way to create a password that meets specific criteria. The user will be prompted to choose the password length (8 - 128 characters) and the character types to be included in the password. The character types available for the user to choose from are:

* Uppercase Letters
* Lowercase Letters
* Numeric characters
* Special Characters 

The Special Characters included in the application can be found in the following link from the OWASP Foundation.https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_special_characters).

By writing the code for this script, I learned how to write JavaScript code and how to approach and address each of the functional requirements. As a note, I was self-learning Java and JavaScript some time ago and I was working on a shuffle deck code. I used the code I prepared for that mini project for this script.
