## Description

The portfolio website was created with the purpose of providing potential employers or clients a way to discover and evaluate my Web Developer skills. My portfolio website has three different sections with the folloing information.

- An about me section with a brief description of myself.
- The project section wich contains the links to deployed projects and their respective repositories.
- A contact me section wich contains my email and links to my social media networks profiles.

Working on this project helped me to improve my skills and knowledge about HTML and CSS. Although I believe I still need lots of practice, I think I made a big leap forward in understanding how the CSS modifies the HTML.
